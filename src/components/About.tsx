          Hello! üëãüèº I'm a California native that grew up in San Diego and is
          currently based in San Francisco. As a Solution Engineer, I approach
          each project as a unique challenge to be solved with a blend of
          creativity, technical expertise, and impactful soft skills. I excel in
          working closely with multiple teams and stakeholders to understand
          design requirements, create sophisticated yet easy to use solutions,
          and effectively communicate concepts to both technical and
          non-technical audiences. I've worked in technical pre sales
          engineering for four years and I have 9+ years of experience working
          in the cybersecurity and computer networking industries. My portfolio
          highlights my software development projects and technical tools used.
          In my free time I like to stay fit, watch the Lakers, and play guitar.
