          Hello! üëãüèº I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer based in San Francisco.
          I'm passionate about learning new things, solving complex problems,
          and creating amazing digital experiences. In 2022, I decided to pursue
          sotware engineering full time and have since created four major
          projects on my own. Currently, I'm working with a small business in
          San Francisco as a Software Engineer to integrate and ETL their
          payment processing data to increase operational efficiency and drive
          business decisions. In my free time I like to stay fit, teach my cats
          new tricks, and play guitar.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xs md:text-sm  xl:text-base ">
          My path into software engineering is a non-conventional one. Before
          jumping in, I was a high performing cybersecurity and computer
          networking pre-sales Systems Engineer with 9 years of experience in
          the industry. After many years of working with product, sales, and
          customers, I continuously ran into a familiar mental road block. A lot
          of days I would think to myself, "Wouldn't it be nice if I could code
          up a feature really quickly" to help build a compelling demo for a
          prospective client. Or "If only I could write an appliation to help
          accelerate some of our sales initiatives" by using empirical data
          versus anecdotally reviewing our wins and losses on a quarterly basis.
          I felt like my abilities were limited by my own toolbox and the skill
          I was missing was being able to build. I decided to use my nights and
          weekends during the pandemic to learn to code in Python & Javascript.
          After a year of diving into Web Development by building websites and
          working on complex problems, I discovered my passion for software
          development. My "Aha!" moment came when I realized that I could
          finally bring all of my ideas to life.
